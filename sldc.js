// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1 Planning
// 2 Analysis of Requirements
// 3 Design
// 5 Implementation
// 4 Testing & Integration
// 6 Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle
    and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "Defining requirements is considered part of planning to determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements. "
const design = "The Design phase models the way a software application will work"
const implementation = "This is the actual writing of the program."
const test = "Once the code is fully created, testing is carried against the requirements. The testing phase of SDLC is about quality assurance. "
const maintain = " In this phase, users discover bugs that werenâ€™t found during testing. These errors need to be resolved, which can spawn new development cycles."
